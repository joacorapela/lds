Linear dynamical systems in Python ![lint+unitTests](https://github.com/joacorapela/lds_python/actions/workflows/lint+unitTests.yml/badge.svg)
 ![docs](https://readthedocs.org/projects/pip/badge/)
----------------------------------

- This repository is under construction. At the moment it only contains functionality for inference, we will soon add functionality for learning.

- documentation, includinng API specification and a Jupyter notebook demonstrating the use of linear dynamical systems for tracking, appears [here](https://lds-python.readthedocs.io/).

- unit tests, run by Github actions, appeare [here](https://github.com/joacorapela/lds_python/tree/master/test).

- derivations of the Kalman filter matrices used in the tracking script [doSmoothFWGMouseTrajectory.py](code/scripts/doSmoothFWGMouseTrajectory.py) appear [here](doc/trackingNotes/trackingNotes.pdf).

More to come ...
