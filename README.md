Linear dynamical systems in Python ![lint+unitTests](https://github.com/joacorapela/lds_python/actions/workflows/lint+unitTests.yml/badge.svg)
 ![docs](https://readthedocs.org/projects/pip/badge/)
----------------------------------

- this repository is under construction. At the moment it only contains functionality for inference. We will soon add functionality for learning.

- documentation, includinng online API specification and a Jupyter notebook (with an interactive figure) demonstrating the use of linear dynamical systems for tracking, appears [here](https://lds-python.readthedocs.io/).

- unit tests, run by Github actions, appear [here](https://github.com/joacorapela/lds_python/tree/master/test).

- derivations of the Kalman filter matrices used for tracking appear [here](docs/trackingNotes/trackingNotes.pdf).

More to come ...
