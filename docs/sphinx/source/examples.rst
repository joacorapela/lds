A demonstration of the use of this code to track the position, velocity and acceleration of a mouse foraging on a maze can be found in the following `notebook <https://github.com/joacorapela/lds_python/blob/master/docs/notebooks/ldsForTracking.ipynb>`_. A mathematical justifaction of the **Discrete Wiener Process Acceleration** model used for this tracking can be found `here <https://github.com/joacorapela/lds_python/blob/master/docs/tracking/tracking.pdf>`_.
