Overview
========

This documentation describes a Python implementation of linear dynamical systems with external inputs.

Note: this is a work in progress. It currently only includes inference, but in the future we will add learning. A far more complete R implementation can be found `here <https://github.com/joacorapela/kalmanFilter>`_.
